 * 
 * Decentralized AI inference, data intelligence, and agent coordination.
 * 
 * Core modules:
 * - Entity: Unified identity across sources with temporal history
 * - Correlation: Cross-source pattern detection and causality discovery
 * - Temporal: Time-native storage where every value has history
 * - Embed: Semantic search and similarity across all data
 * - Ingest: Data ingestion pipeline from connectors
 * - Agent SDK: Client for agents to participate in the network
 * - Fallback: Centralized inference when no agents available
